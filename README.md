**Story of the project**:

Maybe this is not a enough project that shows my skills and attention to the python but this project was very special for me. I coded all of the lines by my self and solved the 
every problem that i had. This project teached me how to surf in google to find my way. The reason i want to start with this project in my github is, i really want to see how improved my self when i look back after years. 
I want to say "Were you really bad that much?" with my knowledges in the future.

**Installation:**

1-Just drop the py and custom library folder in the same folder.

2-Then Run the py on any compiler

3-To know more about the game check the pdf folder

**Basic info about the game**

This is a type of breakout game but the goal is different. There are circles that comes with different speeds and you need to hit them before they reach
the line. You need to wait for reload after each shot.
